# Cisco IOS config mode

`ios-config-mode` is an Emacs major mode that helps to view and edit Cisco IOS (tm) configuration files.

Features include:

- Font locking rules.
- Imenu support
- Indentation
- Convenience routines to add lines to interface blocks (eg. shut all interfaces)
- Support for a decent percentage of the keywords in IOS, ASA, and NX-OS

This package was originally created by Noufal Ibrahim <noufal@nibrahim.net.in>. As Noufal seems to not be updating it any longer, Matthew Sojourner Newton <matt@mnewton.com> has created this fork to maintain it.
